Doing an extra 20-30 minutes of the daily chores can go a long way.</p><p><b>Eat in bed –</b> If your partner is vomiting or ill in the morning, she should get up slowly. She could try to have something plain to eat. Dry toast or crackers can be good.</p><p><b>Food smells –</b> Expectant mothers can acquire a superhuman sense of smell, which can bring on morning sickness. Also the scent of food can trigger nausea. Fish is a common trigger, so are beer and garlic. Every woman is different and some foods that she used to love will be intolerable now. Consider eating cold meals more often as the smells tend not to be as strong.</p><p><b>Citrus –</b> The smell of lemons and oranges can sometimes  reduce nausea.</p><p><b>Drinks –</b> Drink lots of fluids and stay hydrated. However, avoid drinks that are too cold or sharp tasting.</p><p><b>Frequent small meals –</b> This is often better than having two large meals. Eat foods that are high in carbohydrates eg. pasta, bread, rice, etc. Spicy, sweet food might be harder to keep down than plain, savoury foods.</p><p><b>Loose waisted clothes –</b> Your partner should wear something comfortable; tight waist bands can increase nausea.</p>"

Sniff, recoil, then change.</p><h2>Nappy rash</h2><p>Treat with nappy rash creams if suspected.</p><h2>Too hot/cold</h2><p>Pay careful attention that your baby’s clothing is appropriate to the environment, and that it is not too warm or cold.</p><h2>Illness</h2><p>If the crying is accompanied with changes in behaviour, if the baby is burning up, or there is any other reason that you suspect the kid might be ill, check your baby’s temperature. Fever temperature is anything over 37.5°C.</br>If you’re in any doubt go to your GP. See warning signs below.</p>"

Hold the baby close to you, supporting its head on your chest, one arm under its bottom the other holding its back. Hum or sing gently to the baby and gently pat the baby’s bottom in a heartbeat-like rhythm.</p><h2>Rocking</h2><p>In your arms, in a crib, in the pram. Any movement is good. However, don’t use this as a method to lull the baby asleep as they get too used to it and they may become unable to sleep without rocking.</p><h2>Soother/pacifier</h2><p>Always make sure you’re sanitising these regularly. Be warned, it’s a tough habit to break.</p><h2>Colic hold</h2><p>Put the baby face down on your arm with its head towards your elbow, tummy on the palm of your hand. Lowering your arm, so that its head is above its stomach. This hold can also help with wind.</p><h2>Walk</h2><p>The outdoors provides fresh air and a distraction for both of you. Get out and about and stay active.</p><h2>Distract</h2><p>Your baby might just be bored – new games or a change of environment can help.</p><h2>Get naked</h2><p>Some babies like the feeling of being free. You could try taking off your baby’s nappy and letting it kick about, or pop it in the bath and jump in yourself to play.</p><h2>Swaddle</h2><p>The opposite can be true too, tightly wrapping your baby in blankets can make it feel more secure.</p>"

It’s how they grow and develop and learn everything from basic motor skills, to how to communicate. </br>As your baby gets older and learns how to sit up and interact with the world, your games can become more physical and a lot more interactive.</p><h1>The Bang Things Together game</h1><p>Give the baby little wooden or plastic blocks that it can easily grip. Show it how to bang them together. That’s it. That’s a game.</p><h1>Knee Rides</h1><p>Put the kid on your knees and bounce it up and down gently. It’s a good one to do with nursery rhymes. Also, learn some nursery rhymes.</p><h1>Bath Time</h1><p>By three months you’ll be able to introduce toys into bath time that the baby can hold and play with. You can gently splash around too, if the kid enjoys the water.</p><h1>Blowing Bubbles</h1><p>Keeping bubbles on hand at all times is a good idea. After about four months or so the baby will be able to focus its eyes far enough ahead to be entertained by them.</p><h1>Gotcha!</h1><p>Children learn to anticipate actions at around four months. You can sneak up in a  mock-threatening way, and then inflict tickles and cuddles. This sounds really dumb but once you do this once, it’s hard to stop.</p><h1>Aeroplanes</h1><p>This one’s easy – pick the baby up and fly it around in your arms like an aeroplane or a rocket, making all the correct noises. This is about 80% of what being a dad is about.</p><h1>This Little Piggy</h1><p>Does this bring back memories? Count off your baby’s toes to the This Little Piggy nursery rhyme. Why do they like it? We don’t know. But they do.</p>"

Around half of all pregnant women will experience full-on morning sickness, while another third will have frequent bouts of nausea. So it’s very likely that your partner will be affected by it. The good new is that it usually has subsided by week 14.</p><p>There’s no definite answer on the cause of morning sickness but the consensus is that the most likely culprit is the dramatic hormonal changes that your partner’s body is going through.</p><p>Your partner might be one of the lucky ones and escape with only mild symptoms, or maybe none at all. If that’s the case, thank your lucky stars and don’t gloat over other less fortunate fathers-to-be.</p><p>Morning sickness doesn’t just happen in the morning. It can onset at any time of the day or night. It can last for just a short time, or all day long. For some women it’s a minor inconvenience, for others it can be debilitating.</p><p>For a while at least, it’s probably going to be just one of those things.</p>"

If you notice that your partner is looking a little down or peeky, ask is she’s alright or if you can help with anything. If you can, great. If not, then at least she knows you care.</p><p><b>Rest –</b>Encourage your partner to rest. More rest, usually mean less vomiting. Doing an extra 20-30 minutes of the daily chores can go a long way.</p><p><b>Eat in bed –</b> If your partner is vomiting or ill in the morning, she should get up slowly. She could try to have something plain to eat. Dry toast or crackers can be good.</p><p><b>Food smells –</b> Expectant mothers can acquire a superhuman sense of smell, which can bring on morning sickness. Also the scent of food can trigger nausea. Fish is a common trigger, so are beer and garlic. Every woman is different and some foods that she used to love will be intolerable now. Consider eating cold meals more often as the smells tend not to be as strong.</p><p><b>Citrus –</b> The smell of lemons and oranges can sometimes  reduce nausea.</p><p><b>Drinks –</b> Drink lots of fluids and stay hydrated. However, avoid drinks that are too cold or sharp tasting.</p><p><b>Frequent small meals –</b> This is often better than having two large meals. Eat foods that are high in carbohydrates eg. pasta, bread, rice, etc. Spicy, sweet food might be harder to keep down than plain, savoury foods.</p><p><b>Loose waisted clothes –</b> Your partner should wear something comfortable; tight waist bands can increase nausea.</p>"

Measure your nursery before going out to buy. You might choose to have the baby in your room for the first few months, so you’ll have to consider how much space there is beside your bed.</p><h2>Is a mattress included with the cot?</h2><p>Most new cots, or cotbeds, will come with a mattress made to fit it. If you’re buying a secondhand cot, buy a new mattress. Whether your mattress comes with the cot or is bought separately, confirm that it is:</p>"

Be warned, it’s a tough habit to break.</p><h2>Colic hold</h2><p>Put the baby face down on your arm with its head towards your elbow, tummy on the palm of your hand. Lowering your arm, so that its head is above its stomach. This hold can also help with wind.</p><h2>Walk</h2><p>The outdoors provides fresh air and a distraction for both of you. Get out and about and stay active.</p><h2>Distract</h2><p>Your baby might just be bored – new games or a change of environment can help.</p><h2>Get naked</h2><p>Some babies like the feeling of being free.

It’s how they grow and develop and learn everything from basic motor skills, to how to communicate. </br>As your baby gets older and learns how to sit up and interact with the world, your games can become more physical and a lot more interactive.</p><h1>The Bang Things Together game</h1><p>Give the baby little wooden or plastic blocks that it can easily grip. Show it how to bang them together. That’s it. That’s a game.</p><h1>Knee Rides</h1><p>Put the kid on your knees and bounce it up and down gently. It’s a good one to do with nursery rhymes. Also, learn some nursery rhymes.</p><h1>Bath Time</h1><p>By three months you’ll be able to introduce toys into bath time that the baby can hold and play with. You can gently splash around too, if the kid enjoys the water.</p><h1>Blowing Bubbles</h1><p>Keeping bubbles on hand at all times is a good idea. After about four months or so the baby will be able to focus its eyes far enough ahead to be entertained by them.</p><h1>Gotcha!</h1><p>Children learn to anticipate actions at around four months. You can sneak up in a  mock-threatening way, and then inflict tickles and cuddles. This sounds really dumb but once you do this once, it’s hard to stop.</p><h1>Aeroplanes</h1><p>This one’s easy – pick the baby up and fly it around in your arms like an aeroplane or a rocket, making all the correct noises. This is about 80% of what being a dad is about.</p><h1>This Little Piggy</h1><p>Does this bring back memories? Count off your baby’s toes to the This Little Piggy nursery rhyme. Why do they like it? We don’t know. But they do.</p>"
