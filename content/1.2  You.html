<div class="first-trimester"><h1>You</h1><div class="normal"><h1>You</h1><p>Your partner will be doing most of the baby work for the next 40 weeks, but that doesn't mean you're off the hook. You have a little over nine months to get ready for the biggest change you'll ever experience in life. The time to start making the adjustment is right now, Daddyo.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Be kind</h2><p>It's pretty likely that your partner is going to have some mood swings. This is normal. Be smart about it and try to rise. Your partner could be equally frustrated by how she feels. Stay calm to diffuse the tension and gain kudos in the long run.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Do stuff</h2><p>That means cleaning, vacuuming, shopping, laundry and all the other things you probably hate doing. If your partner is the clean freak in your relationship try to meet her at least halfway on standards. Pre-empting arguments about this can be a real win. (if you're the clean freak, then carry on with what you're doing.)</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Get fit</h2><p>The next while is going to be physically demanding getting into a routine of a little extra exercise pays off in the long run. Join a gym. Do a bootcamp. Go jogging. Start cycling. It all helps. It'll probably give you some time to think too, which can be nice.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Make a budget</h2><p>Figure out the numbers. A new kid is expensive and you may need to make some changes now to afford things down the track.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Lifestyle</h2><p>You're probably going to need to be a bit more responsible about your time. That could mean cutting down on the lads nights out, or not spending three weekends away a month rock climbing.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Learn how to cook</h2><p>An incredibly useful skill. If you know how to cook already, that's great. Now learn how to cook for a pregnant lady and a baby.</p></div></div>
