<div class="third-trimester"><h1>Third Trimester</h1><div class="normal"><h1>The Baby</h1></div><div class="normal"><p>Week 18 to  birth (usually between weeks 38-40). There'll be less kicking and activity over the course of this trimester - mostly because the growing baby is running out of space in the womb. Your kid will now be capable of responding to sound, light and touch. From week 26 it is possible that the baby could survive outside the womb, albeit with intensive medical care. Closer to the time of birth the baby should position itself head down and lower down the abdomen.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>Your partner</h1><p>Your partner will likely be in serious discomfort, so you'll be called upon to help out even more. Resting will be difficult and she will have to sleep on her side. She will probably be nesting too, so expect demands to move things around or instruction to have the place tidier than normal. Ailments could include constipation, varicose veins, hemorrhoids, shortness of breath and swollen ankles. Her bladder will have pressure on it, meaning frequent trips to the bathroom. She'll probably also experience Braxton Hicks contractions - a brief tensing of your partner's tummy. They aren't a sign of the onset of labour, just a normal part of pregnancy.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>You</h1><p>Yes, you get to be involved now. Start to talk to the baby, if you haven't already. It can feel a bit strange at first, especially if you're trying to think up something to say on the spot. You could try reading something aloud next to the bump. Children's books are good because they're easy to read and act out. If you feel awkward doing this, then try humming songs. You'll be doing plenty of singing when the baby arrives, so getting practice in now can't hurt. Hopefully your partner will think this is all cool and not weird.</p></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Milestones</h1><ul><p></p><li>Antenatal classes</li><p></p><li>Hitting the due date</li></ul></div><div class="warning-list"><h1>Warning signs</h1><ul><p></p><li>Unusual abdominal pain</li><p></p><li>Vaginal bleeding</li><p></p><li>Chronic nausea or vomiting</li><p></p><li>Waters breaking too early</li></ul></div></div>
