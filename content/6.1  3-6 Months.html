And if you're lucky, you've found a routine that working for you and your partner.</p><h1>The baby</h1><p>Your baby will now be more active. There'll be lot more kicking and wriggling and it'll have much better control over its head movements. You'll notice how the baby will start to rock back and forth, and towards the end of the six months it'll probably be able to roll over. They could also be able to sit up by themselves and crawling is probably soon to follow.</p><p>Hand eye coordination is going to get a lot better also. The baby will be able to grasp and rattle small objects and is probably putting anything and everything in its mouth. It will also be able to pull things towards it.</p><p>At this point, it'll also be able to recognise familiar faces, follow motion and will likely start to focus on bright colours.</br>You'll be introduced to a whole new range of sounds, from squealing to gurgling, and the baby might make noises then wait for you to respond.</p><h1>Your partner</h1><p>Things will have settled for you partner too. She should be getting more sleep and probably will be back to her normal self.</p></div><div class="warning-list"><h1>Warning signs</h1><ul><p></p><li>Stiff muscles</li><p></p><li>Their body is floppy</li><p></p><li>They only use one hand to reach</li><p></p><li>They don't have any response to visual cues</li><p></p><li>They don't reach for objects or put things in their mouth</li><p></p><li>Their eyes turn in or out</li><p></p><li>They don't laugh or squeal</li></ul></div></div>
