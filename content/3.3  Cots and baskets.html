<div class="third-trimester"><h1>Cots and baskets</h1><div class="normal"><h1>Sleeping Cots and baskets</h1><p>Newborn babies eat, cry and sleep. The more they sleep, the less they do the other two things. So getting the right shut-eye gear is essential.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>Baskets</h1><p>Moses baskets are useful for the first month or so. They're portable and usually have a stand that folds away. However, they will be outgrown quickly and they can be expensive. If you're thinking about using one, you could consider either borrowing one or buying secondhand.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>Cots</h1><p>Your baby is probably going to be sleeping in this for quite some time. It's worth putting some thought into your purchase. Here's the Daddyo cot checklist:</p><h2>Does it comply with all EU standards?</h2><p>As with everything that you purchase for your baby, check that it is safety compliant. If you're buying secondhand, make sure that the model you're buying hasn't been recalled due to safety concerns since its original purchase.</p><h2>Check the size</h2><p>You want a cot that's both big enough for your baby's needs and fits within the space you have available. Measure your nursery before going out to buy. You might choose to have the baby in your room for the first few months, so you'll have to consider how much space there is beside your bed.</p><h2>Is a mattress included with the cot?</h2><p>Most new cots, or cotbeds, will come with a mattress made to fit it. If you're buying a secondhand cot, buy a new mattress. Whether your mattress comes with the cot or is bought separately, confirm that it is:</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Does the cot feel sturdy and durable?</h2><p>If you're buying flatpack make sure that you've had the opportunity to look at a fully built show unit.</p><h2>Does it have a drop down side?</h2><p>A drop down side can be convenient for access but make sure that it is fully safety compliant, with a lock in the lower position. Frequently check that the mechanism is in good working order. Cots with drop down sides have been banned in the US since 2011. They are still available for sale in the EU, as long as they have met certain safety criteria.</p><h2>Height adjustable?</h2><p>A convenient, useful feature.</p></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Make sure it's</h1><ul><p></p><li>Flame resistant.</li><p></p><li>The correct size for your cot.</li><p></p><li>And comfortably firm.</li></ul></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Cotbeds - these are cots that convert into small beds, either by simply removing the sides or by more complex re-configurations. Yes, they can be more expensive but your toddler could be sleeping in it for a number of years. Before you buy, make sure to have had a good look at the cot both in its normal and converted state.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Baby sleeping bags - these are recommended. They're better than duvets or pillows, which can restrict the baby's movements and make them too warm. And at the same time, they can't be kicked off and they help prevent your baby getting their feet caught in the bars of the cot.</p></div></div>
