<div class="labour"><h1>Labour</h1><div class="normal"><h1>Labour</h1><p>This phase is all action. And sometimes, a fair bit of waiting around too.</br>The baby is ready to go. Hopefully it happens on, or near, the due date. However, early or late births are not uncommon. Unfortunately, every woman's labour is different so it's hard to give hard and fast rules.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>Also, you're probably not going to be required to drive at breakneck speeds to the hospital. Early labour usually gives you plenty of time to drive safely.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>The Baby</h1><p>The baby will be born head first, or legs first (breech birth).</br>Normal birth weight is between 6lb and 9lb.<p></div><div class="normal"><h1>The Mother</h1><p>There are three stages to labour</p></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Stage 1 (Starting)</h1><ul><p></p><li>Latent - Contractions start and then come at intervals of 5 mins and last for 30 seconds. While is is going on, the cervix is dilating to 3/4cm. This can take quite a few hours. So be patient.</li><p></p><li>Active - Contractions get stronger and become more frequent. They're also likely to be quite painful. Cervix dilates to 6-7cm. By now you'll be at the hospital and you partner will have an internal examination to assess the baby's position.</li><p></p><li>Transition - The time between contractions decreases, often to the point that it feels like there's no break between them. Your partner may start feeling the need to push. At this point the cervix should be fully dilated.</li><p></p><li>For first time mothers, the latent stage can last more than eight hours, although it is unlikely to last for more than 18. This reduces to an average of five hours for women who've given birth before.</li></ul></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Stage 2 (Pushing)</h1><ul><p></p><li>The cervix is fully open at 10cm.</li><p></p><li>Her waters should break naturally.</li><p></p><li>There'll be very strong contractions every 2-3 minutes. They may feel constant.</li><p></p><li>Your partner has to push. This will last some time and will be exhausting for her. Your job is to support her.</li><p></p><li>The baby is born.</li><p></p><li>The midwives will take the baby aside briefly for some medical checks, to ensure that windpipe is clear and the baby is breathing correctly.</li><p></p><li>Congratulations.</li></ul></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Stage 3 (It's not over)</h1><ul><p></p><li>The womb contracts, and the placenta exits. You'll probably be distracted with the new arrival, but your partner still has to push the placenta out.</li><p></p><li>Any vaginal tearing will be repaired. Yes, tearing. It's also common for women to have an episiotomy, which is a surgical cut to the vaginal wall to aide childbirth.</li></ul></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Milestones</h1><ul><p></p><li>Contractions</li><p></p><li>Getting to the hospital</li><p></p><li>Internal examination</li><p></p><li>Waters breaking</li><p></p><li>Full dilation</li><p></p><li>Total agony</li><p></p><li>Meeting your kid</li></ul></div></div>
