<div class="first-trimester"><h1>Morning Sickness</h1><div class="normal"><h1>What is it?</h1><p>Morning sickness is the common name for Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy (NVP) that most women experience at some point in the first trimester of pregnancy. Around half of all pregnant women will experience full-on morning sickness, while another third will have frequent bouts of nausea. So it's very likely that your partner will be affected by it. The good new is that it usually has subsided by week 14.</p><p>There's no definite answer on the cause of morning sickness but the consensus is that the most likely culprit is the dramatic hormonal changes that your partner's body is going through.</p><p>Your partner might be one of the lucky ones and escape with only mild symptoms, or maybe none at all. If that's the case, thank your lucky stars and don't gloat over other less fortunate fathers-to-be.</p><p>Morning sickness doesn't just happen in the morning. It can onset at any time of the day or night. It can last for just a short time, or all day long. For some women it's a minor inconvenience, for others it can be debilitating.</p><p>For a while at least, it's probably going to be just one of those things.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>What to do</h1><p><b>Care -</b> It's easy to forget how much nausea sucks. If you notice that your partner is looking a little down or peeky, ask if she's alright or if you can help with anything. If you can, great. If not, then at least she knows you care.</p><p><b>Rest -</b>Encourage your partner to rest. More rest usually means less vomiting. Doing an extra 20-30 minutes of the daily chores can go a long way.</p><p><b>Eat in bed -</b> If your partner is vomiting or ill in the morning, she should get up slowly. She could try to have something plain to eat. Dry toast or crackers can be good.</p><p><b>Food smells -</b> Expectant mothers can acquire a superhuman sense of smell, which can bring on morning sickness. Also the scent of food can trigger nausea. Fish is a common trigger, so are beer and garlic. Every woman is different and some foods that she used to love will be intolerable now. Consider eating cold meals more often as the smells tend not to be as strong.</p><p><b>Citrus -</b> The smell of lemons and oranges can sometimes  reduce nausea.</p><p><b>Drinks -</b> Drink lots of fluids and stay hydrated. However, avoid drinks that are too cold or sharp tasting.</p><p><b>Frequent small meals -</b> This is often better than having two large meals. Eat foods that are high in carbohydrates eg. pasta, bread, rice, etc. Spicy, sweet food might be harder to keep down than plain, savoury foods.</p><p><b>Loose waisted clothes -</b> Your partner should wear something comfortable; tight waist bands can increase nausea.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Ginger biscuits, ginger ale or ginger supplements might alleviate the symptoms, as long as they contain real ginger. Just make sure, particularly with the supplements, that you are buying from a reputable source.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Aftershave has an extremely strong smell that can be a trigger for morning sickness. Put the bottle away, if it's a problem.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Morning sickness is more likely to occur when your partner is tired and emotional. As she may not have told her family and friends that she's pregnant, you're the one on-call to support her. As no one probably knows that your partner is pregnant yet, keep a couple of excuses handy to explain why you're both suddenly leaving parties in a hurry.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>Warning signs</h1><p>Some women experience severe or extreme morning sickness, which is called hyperemesis gravidarum. If your partner is chronically and violently ill, get medical advice. She may need to be treated in hospital.</p><p><b>Watch out for - </b>Dizzy or faint spells; very dark urine; stomach pains; high temperatures; or blood in vomit.</p></div></div>
