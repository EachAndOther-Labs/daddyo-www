<div class="three-six-months"><h1>Teething</h1><div class="normal"><h1>What is it?</h1><p>Babies usually develop teeth while in the womb but they only start coming through their gums after around six months (although sometimes it can happen earlier). It can be pretty painful for them.</p><p>It goes: bottom front teeth (5-7 months); top front teeth (6-8 months); teeth on either side of the top front teeth (9-11 months); teeth on either side of the bottom front teeth (10-12 months); back teeth (12-16 months); canines (16-20 months); second molars (20-30 months).</p></div><div class="warning-list"><h1>How to know if your baby is teething?</h1><ul><p>Discomfort</p><li>It's clear that the baby is in pain.</li><p>Cheek flushed</p><li>Generally just one cheek.</li><p>Sore gums</p><li>You'll be able to notice a single red patch where the tooth is coming down.</li><p>Extra dribbling</p><li>Even more than normal.</li><p>Chewing</p><li>The baby will try to gnaw on anything and everything. Including their own fingers.</li></ul></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>What to do</h1><ul><p>Comforting</p><li>Pick your baby up or play with it. It might distract the kid from the pain for a while.</li><p>Teething ring</p><li>Great to chew on and a good distraction. Some brands can be chilled in the fridge to give extra relief.</li><p>Clean, cold, wet flannel cloth</p><li>This can make a good makeshift teething ring.</li><p>Teething gel</p><li>A sugar free, mildly anesthetic gel that helps to numb pain. Only for babies over four months. Get advice from your pharmacist.</li><p>Crunchy food</p><li>Slices of carrots or apples are a good healthy thing for babies to chew on. Always supervise.</li><p>Painkillers</p><li>If your baby is in real distress, you could consider specific painkillers made for babies. Talk to you pharmacist or GP to see if this course of action is needed.</li></ul></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Sometimes you hear that teething brings on diarrhoea or fever. There is no evidence for this. If your baby has any of these symptoms, don't ignore them and put them down to teething.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Teeth need to be cleaned. Put a tiny bit of fluoride toothpaste on a some clean, damp gauze. Rub this over and around the baby's teeth. Job done. Do this twice a day.</p></div></div>
