<div class="first-trimester"><h1>Cooking</h1><div class="normal"><h1>Cooking</h1><p>This may seem like a small thing but there's lots of good reasons to brush up on your cooking skills..</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Win win</h2><p>1. If you take responsibility for most of the cooking, it'll take pressure off your partner during the pregnancy, which gives her more time to rest. More rest, generally means less of the bad pregnancy stuff. So win win.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Save cash</h2><p>2. If you don't usually cook at home already, you'll find that you're saving yourselves some cash.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Healthier</h2><p>3. You'll know exactly what you're eating from a nutritional point of view, meaning you can both make good choices.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Faster</h2><p>4. When you're both tired you'll be able to cook something healthy, fast. Or better still, you'll have stuff in the freezer ready to be microwaved.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Kudos</h2><p>5. You'll get kudos. Lots and lots of kudos.</p></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>What to do:</h1><ul><p></p><li><b>Focus on simple meals</b> - It's better to get the basics right than learn how to plan elaborate dinner parties.

BBC Food, the Guardian Life & Style section, and Epicurious are excellent resources for healthy quick meals. Keep a note of the ones that work.  </li><p></p><li><b>Classes</b> - Cooking lessons can be expensive. However beginners classes can be a good way to get you started.  </li><p></p><li><b>Baby cook books</b> - Although you won't need it right away, learning to cook healthy tasty food for you baby is a great way to ensure they're getting the nutrition they need. And it feels brilliant when you've cooked something healthy that your kid loves.  </li></ul></div></div>
