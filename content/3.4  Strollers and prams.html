<div class="third-trimester"><h1>Strollers and prams</h1><div class="normal"><h1>Keep in mind:</h1><h2>Cost</h2><p>Buggies can be expensive. How much you spend on one is up to you and your partner. Consider buying secondhand if you can find one in good condition.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Safety first</h2><p>Whether buying from a shop or secondhand always make sure that the buggy complies with proper safety standards.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Research</h2><p>Talk to friends and family who've had kids recently. Find out what's worked for them. If you get a chance, try out a friend's buggy for yourself. (Even better if there's a helpful kid already in it.) Do your own research online on the model you're thinking of buying. Time spent researching will save time in the buggy shop, and that'll be time well spent.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Use from birth</h2><p>Most buggies can't be used from birth. You'll need to check with your retailer to assess suitability.</p></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Checklist:</h1><ul><p>Size</p><li>Is the buggy going to fit in your car boot? Three wheelers in particular take up a lot of room.</li><p>Ease of folding</p><li>Can you easily collapse or fold the stroller? Do you need both hands to do it, or can you do it with one? These are important questions because with one arm holding a baby many simple-seeming tasks become very tricky. Foldability is also critical if you take public transport regularly.</li><p>Lifestyle</p><li>If you and your partner have an active, outdoorsy lifestyle you'll probably want a stroller that can take some punishment and that is maneuverable. Ask friends with similar habits what models they're using.</li><p>Five point harness</p><li>These are the safety belts that keep the kid securely in the buggy. The harness goes over your baby's shoulders, around the waist and between the legs. Make sure your buggy's got them, and that they're good. </li><p>Brakes</p><li>Even if the model you're looking at has a good safety record, check the brakes on the actual one that you're buying and make sure you're satisfied. Kick the tires, metaphorically.</li><p>Adjustable handles</p><li>Essential for if there's a big difference in height between you and your partner. Even if there isn't, this is still a very useful feature to have. </li><p>Add ons</p><li>Check to see what's included in the price. Usually the nice-to-have extras, including rain covers and sun umbrellas, are sold separately. </li><p>Guarantee</p><li>If you're buying from new, try to look for a local retailer that offers more than a one year guarantee. Strollers are an expensive purchase and having confidence that you can use the same one for child number two is an advantage.</li></ul></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Types of Strollers:</h1><ul><p>Travel systems</p><li>A great solution for newborns. You get portability and easy switching from pram to car seat. You'll need to check if separate adaptors are needed to correctly fit the car seat.</li><p>Buggy/stroller</p><li>Not suitable from birth but a good all rounder. Usually lower cost and reasonably compact.</li><p>Three Wheeler</p><li>Bulkier and trickier to fold, which can be a consideration for public transport, but a lot more maneuverable when you've got it set. Great for active lifestyles.</li></ul></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>If you're going to the shop to have a look at your options, avoid busy shopping times. You'll be able to spend a more time with the retail staff and probably be able to give the strollers a better going over.</p></div></div>
