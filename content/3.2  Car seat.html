<div class="third-trimester"><h1>Car seat</h1><div class="normal"><h1>Buying a car seat</h1><p>As a parent, your first job is to make sure that your baby is as safe as possible. A good, safe, properly installed car seat is part of this.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>You're likely to need two types of seat in your baby's first year and a half. When choosing a car seat you use weight and height as a gauge, not age.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>You use a rear facing seat from birth. By the time your baby is about 13kg, it will most likely have outgrown rear facing car seats and you'll need to switch to a front facing one.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>You should keep your baby in a rear facing seat as long as possible, but its head should never reach the top of the seat. </p></div><div class="normal"><p>As usual with baby equipment, the choice can be overwhelming at first. Be practical, do research online, and buy from a reputable source. Take the advice of relatives and friends who've recently had kids on the car seats that they've used.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>Things to keep in mind</h1></div><div class="normal"><h2>Head-hugger or a head cushion</h2><p>Helpful to support your baby's head in the early months.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Fitting service</h2><p> Consider buying from a source that also offers to install it for you. Most car seats are manageable on your own but it might be worth checking all the same.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>ISOFIX</h2><p>This is an international standard for fitting car seats. You should check if your car(s) supports this standard. Some older cars don't. Although many seats also fit to adult seat belts, ISOFIX is recommended.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>UN-ECE</h2><p>Your car seat needs to be compliant with EU and UN safety standards.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>Warning Signs:</h1><p></p></div><div class="warning-list"><h1>Warning signs</h1><ul><p></p><li>Always make sure that the seat is fully secure. Check it regularly for defects, damage or stress on any of the fixtures.</li><p></p><li><b>Never</b> install a rear facing baby seat in the front seat of a car without first disabling the airbag. It's very dangerous and illegal.</li></ul></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Don't buy a second hand car seat. You can't be guaranteed that it's still safe. Buy straight from a store to ensure that you're getting a product in good condition and in perfect working order.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Fit the seat in advance of going to the hospital. They can be tricky and you don't want to be fussing around trying to fit a seat when your partner is waiting for you to pick her up and take her home.</p></div></div>
