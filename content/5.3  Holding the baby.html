<div class="zero-three-months"><h1>Holding the baby</h1><div class="normal"><h1>You'll be fine...</h1><p>Holding your baby for the first time is an extraordinary feeling. It's also terrifying. However, as with everything to do with kids, what's strange at first becomes second nature very quickly.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>General rules</h1><p>Always support the baby's head. Newborns can't support the weight of their own heads, so this is really important.</p><p>Keeping the head above the tummy aids digestion and can help prevent wind.</p><p>Be calm and confident holding the baby.</br>Talking will relax the baby while you hold it.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>Daddyo holds</h1></div><div class="normal"><h2>The classic</h2><p>Support the baby with one arm under it's bottom, use the other hand to support its head and hold the baby against your chest and shoulder. This is also the basic winding manoeuvre.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Arm crook</h2><p>Hold the baby in the cook of your arm, its head supported by your upper arm and chest. You can use your other arm for extra support if it's needed. The kid will just curl up and sleep, if you're lucky.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Facing front</h2><p>Hold the baby with its back against your chest, placing one arm under the baby's bottom and the other on their torso. This is a great when your baby needs a little distraction because they can see everything going on around them.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Leg prop</h2><p>When you're sitting, pull up your knees and prop the baby up with its head on your lap and its feet on your stomach. Good way to play.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Colic hold</h2><p>Put the baby face down on your arm with their head towards your elbow, tummy on the palm of your hand. Lowering your arm, so that their head is above their stomach. It can help wind them.</p></div></div>
