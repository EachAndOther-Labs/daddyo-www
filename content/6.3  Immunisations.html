<div class="three-six-months"><h1>Immunisations</h1><div class="normal"><h1>Immunisation</h1><p>Seeing your child get an injection can be tough. Seeing them get really sick is a whole lot tougher. Vaccination is a critical way to keep your child, and other children, safe.</p><p>Once you vaccinate against a disease, your baby's body will be able to produce antibodies to fight that disease. They are very quick to administer, safe and extremely effective.</br>Not vaccinating your child can put it at risk.</p><p>Vaccinations available for your child may differ between regions so you should check with your GP.</p><h1>Common vaccinations and timelines</h1><h2>Two months</h2><p><b>5-in-1 vaccine -</b> Protects against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b (which can cause meningitis).</br><b>PCV (Pneumococcal vaccine)</b></br><b>Rotavirus vaccine</b></p><h2>Three months</h2><p><b>5-in1 vaccine -</b> Second dose</br><b>Meningitis C</b></br><b>Rotavirus vaccine -</b> Second dose</p><h2>Four months</h2><p><b>5-in1 vaccine -</b> Third dose</br><b>PCV (Pneumococcal vaccine) -</b> second dose</p><p>Your GP will advise you of further schedules for subsequent vaccinations.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>There may be legitimate medical reasons not to use vaccines. This should be the exception not the rule and you should check with your GP.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Your baby is <b>not</b> going to like this. Expect lots of crying and get ready to combat with plenty of cuddles.</p></div><div class="warning-list"><h1>Warning Signs</h1><ul><p></p><li>Problems with vaccines are rare. There is one chance in millions that your baby will experience anaphylactic shock. If this does happen, the people giving the baby the vaccine will be trained to deal with this and will know what to do. As with any medicine, monitor your baby closely in the days following the dose.</li></ul></div></div>
