<div class="first-trimester"><h1>First Trimester</h1><div class="normal"><h1>The Baby</h1><p>The fertalised egg attaches itself to the wall of the womb. It starts off as just one cell, which quickly multiplies. Until week eight, it's technically known as an embryo. By then all of the major organs will be in place and medically it's referred to as a foetus. You'll call it 'the baby'.</p><p>Your baby will grow from microscopic size at conception, to the size of a plum by week eight. By week 12 it'll be about 7.5-10cm long and weigh a whopping 28g.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>Your Partner</h1><p>Every pregnancy is different but the flood of new hormones is likely to cause some issues, and for many women (and therefore men) the first trimester is the least enjoyable. Most of the really uncomfortable symptoms take place over the first 12 weeks: tiredness, heartburn, indigestion, wind, constipation and sensitivity to odours. Your partner is also likely to suffer from morning sickness, which is a misleadingly named ailment because it can last all day.</p><p>There's usually no signs of a bump at this point, which can give the whole experience an air of unreality. But trust the baby scans.</p></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Milestones</h1><ul><p></p><li>Adjusting diet and lifestyle.</li><p></p><li>Telling your GP.</li><p></p><li>First scan at eight weeks.</li></ul></div><div class="normal"><h1>Warning signs</h1><p>Unfortunately, this is the stage of pregnancy when the risk of miscarriage is at its highest. In most cases it's a natural occurrence because the foetus is not developing correctly. You should consult your GP at the first sign of any abdominal pains or unusual bleeding. Be vigilant. But also try not to worry. </p></div></div>
