<div class="zero-three-months"><h1>Caring for partner</h1><div class="normal"><h1>Caring for your partner</h1><p>By this point you've probably made many adjustments to your lifestyle, and you've probably taken over many, if not most, of the household tasks. After the baby is born, you're on the line to do even more.</p><p>In the first few weeks, your partner shouldn't have to worry about anything other than taking care of the baby and recovering from childbirth.</p><h2>Food</h2><p>You should have already stocked the freezer so you'll have an easy ride for the first week or two. After that, plan simple, easy to cook meals in advance for your partner.</p><h2>Housework</h2><p>You both should be comfortable to let things slip a little in the early days. But whatever slack needs to be taken up, you'll have to do it, Daddyo.</p><h2>Family Time</h2><p>Your partner probably has friends or close family that are a big part of her life. Make sure to give her time and space to introduce these people to the baby. If her friend flies into town to visit the baby, get out of the house for a while.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>Breast feeding mums</h1><h2>Increase fluids</h2><p>Taking on extra water, fruit and milk all helps.</p><h2>Diet</h2><p>Your partner should maintain a healthy, balanced nutritious diet. Lactating mothers should make sure to eat whenever hungry and not miss meals.</p><h2>Bottle feeding</h2><p>After two or three weeks you should introduce breastfed babies to a bottle for nighttime feeding. This will allow you to take up some of the feeding duties and allow your partner more sleep.</p><h2>Nipple shields</h2><p>If your partner is breastfeeding, pick these up for her. Breastfeeding can be tough going. It can take time to get the knack, and if the baby is not latched on properly there's a risk of mastitis, which can be painful. Nipple shields can really help.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Many women want to lose the weight that they put on during pregnancy. If your partner is one of these women, you'll want her to be careful. Rapid weight loss can be bad for her health, and, if she's breastfeeding, the baby's too.</br>Normal rules for healthy weight loss apply - good quality balanced diet, and plenty of exercise (if and when she's feeling up to it). Most importantly, don't pressure her into losing weight.</p></div></div>
