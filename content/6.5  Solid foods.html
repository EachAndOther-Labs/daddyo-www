<div class="three-six-months"><h1>Solid foods</h1><div class="normal"><h1>Weaning and solid foods</h1><p>Introducing solids into your baby's diet is called weaning, and it starts at about six months. Before this point, their digestive system just isn't developed enough to handle anything other than breast milk or baby formula.</p><p>Even though you start introducing solids you should still continue to bottle or breastfeed.</p></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Workstation</h1><ul><p></p><li>Bowl + spoon</li><p></p><li>Food</li><p></p><li>Bib</li><p></p><li>Highchair</li><p></p><li>Baby wipes/cloth</li><p></p><li>Microwave/stove</li></ul></div><div class="normal"><p>Judging the amount of food is hard at first. A baby at four months can eat anywhere between 1-3 tablespoons of food at 1-2 'meals', in addition to bottles or breastfeeding.  By six months, it'll be around 4 teaspoons, 3 times a day. The guideline is, feed until the kid has had enough. You'll get to know your baby's appetite.</p></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>The Job</h1><ul><p></p><li>Heat the food up in the microwave or on the stove.</li><p></p><li>Taste it to check the temperature.
