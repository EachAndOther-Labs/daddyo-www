Use the room heater if you have to. Babies are very sensitive to temperature.</p><p>Get the temperature of the water right - not too hot, not too cold. Use the baby bath thermometer to judge. Around 37Â°C is right.</p><p>  Put the baby on a changing mat or on your knee and undress them. You can leave the nappy on for now.</p><p>Wrap the baby in the hoody towel so that it stays warm until you're ready to pop it in the water.</p><p>Dip the cotton wool in the water and carefully wipe around the eyes, go from the nose out. Use a different cotton ball for each eye to prevent transferring infection.</p><p>Use more pieces of cotton wool to clean the baby's ears. Don't force the cotton wool into the ear, just wash around it. Never use a cotton bud.</p><p>Use a very small amount of the shampoo very gently wash the baby's scalp and hair.</p><p>Use the plastic cup to scoop up a little water and wash the shampoo out of the hair. To avoid getting shampoo in their eyes you can tilt the baby's head back slightly or place your hand over its forehead.</p><p>Dry the baby's hair with towel.</p><p>Now you're ready for the bath</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Stage two - The Bath</h2><p>Remove the nappy and lower the baby into the water, using an arm to support its head.</p><p>Continue to wash the baby using the baby sponges paying special attention to neck, hands, bottom and feet.</p><p>Swish water gently around the tub.</p><p>Bathing your baby should be a fun experience. As your baby gets older, start to introduce toys and play games. Talk as you wash; it helps babies relax.</p><p>When you're all done, carefully take the baby out of the water and wrap it in the hoody towel.</p><p><b>Never leave a baby alone in water, even for a second.</b></p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Finishing up</h2><p>On the changing mat, carefully pat the baby dry.</p><p>Make sure to dry in between skin folds like arm pits, behind knees and around the groin. Check for irritated or dry skin.</p><p>You can rub in some baby oil or cream but make sure you do this on a stable surface or on the floor as they may be a little slippery afterwards.</p><p>Put on a new nappy.</p><p>Put on fresh clothes (on the baby - but you too if it got messy).</p> </div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>If you find that your baby often gets surprised by being put in water and cries, try pouring water on its legs before putting it in the bath. Alternatively, you can bath together.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>You shouldn't bathe a baby until the umbilical stump has fallen off - usually about two weeks after birth. Until then, you should only wash the baby using a clean warm cloth and cotton wool for the face. Using powder around the the stump is a good way to keep the area dry.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>You should 'top and tail' your baby every day, which means clean their face, neck, hands and bottom. But you only need to bathe the baby two to three times a week. If your baby loves bath time, you can do it more often. Be careful though, bathing can make the skin dry out.</p></div></div>
