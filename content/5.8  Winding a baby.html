This means that they often swallow air when they feed or cry, which makes their tummy swell and bloat. It's very uncomfortable for them. This is called wind.</br>Some babies get wind very frequently, but it should reduce as they learn better control in feeding and their digestive track matures.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>Identifying wind</h1><p>The baby might stop sucking on the bottle before it's finished. It might squirm, make faces and wail. You may even be able to hear trapped air rattling in its stomach. It might be in extra discomfort when lying flat on its back.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>When babies are born their digestive tracts are not fully developed.

Lean the baby forward, supporting the chest with one arm and holding the chin in your hand. With your other hand pat or rub the baby's back gently, but firmly. This has two advantages. Firstly, it's easy to do when feeding and secondly when they burp and milk comes up it will dribble on them and their bib not on you.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Shoulder pat</h2><p>Place some muslin cloth on your shoulder. Hold the baby against your chest with an arm under the baby's bottom for support. With your other hand pat or run the baby's back gently, but firmly. It may also help to gently bounce on the spot. It may take a couple of tries.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Lap pat</h2><p>Put the baby face down on your lap. Keeping the baby steady, gently pat or rub it's back with your free hand.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Sometimes a baby has trouble bringing up wind. It might be either that they don't need to, or that their immature digestive tract is allowing air further into their stomach. If the baby is still clearly uncomfortable, cycle through all the methods above until the baby does a big burp, which is satisfying for both of you.</p></div></div>
