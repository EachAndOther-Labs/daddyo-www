<div class="first-trimester"><h1>Cravings</h1><div class="normal"><h1>What are they?</h1><p>Pregnancy is often associated with food cravings. They often have a sudden onset and can be quite intense. It could be a craving for something that your partner normally likes, normally doesn't like, or something that's downright weird. (Alternatively, your partner might go off foods that she used to love.)</p></div><div class="normal"><p>You can make them work for you - a well-timed trip to an Indian takeaway for a curry craving can earn you a lot of good will.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>What causes them?</h2><p>There's no consensus on what causes cravings. They usually start in the first trimester, are at their strongest in the second, and have generally subsided before the birth of the baby.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>It's common for women to crave dairy products, sweet foods or salty foods including pickles. Unless it's explicitly against medical advice, your partner should feel free to satisfy them. Stock the fridge and have takeaway menus to hand.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Any cravings your partner normally has are likely to continue, whether they're harmful (nicotine), or not so harmful (chocolate). Obviously, the harmful cravings should be ignored.</p></div></div>
