<div class="zero-three-months"><h1>Baby Talk</h1><div class="normal"><h1>Talk to the Baby</h1><p>If you've never been around kids before it might feel strange to natter away to a baby. It'll probably feel very natural when you're holding your own.</br>Babies understand tones from an early age. Talking to them can soothe and relax them, and of course, it's good for speech development. But that's further down the road.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>What to do:</h1><h2>Talk a lot</h2><p>Talking comforts babies and shows that you're giving attention. Talk whenever you're doing an activity with the baby, such as bathing, feeding. Even if you're just nearby, you should chat away.</p><h2>Say their name</h2><p>It will be several months before the baby will recognise its own name but the more you use it the faster they will learn. Even though the baby may not realise that the name refers to them, they can still get excited by it. They'll know that it's a special word.</p><h2>Eye contact</h2><p>Maintaining eye contact is useful for creating a connection between you and the baby as you talk. It's also an added distraction if you're trying to do something important at the same time, like change a nappy.</p><h2>Raise the pitch of your voice</h2><p>A higher pitch that imitates a female voice, can comfort babies and they naturally connect to it.</p><h2>Make faces</h2><p>As you talk, be extra expressive. You will look ridiculous when you do this and you will not care.</p></div></div>
