Try a feed.</p><h2>Trapped wind</h2><p>If your baby is pulling its legs, flailing its limbs along with intense crying, it might have wind. Using one of the winding techniques.</p><h2>Nappy change</h2><p>You'll know pretty quick if your baby's nappy needs changing. Sniff, recoil, then change.</p><h2>Nappy rash</h2><p>Treat with nappy rash creams if suspected.</p><h2>Too hot/cold</h2><p>Pay careful attention that your baby's clothing is appropriate to the environment, and that it is not too warm or cold.</p><h2>Illness</h2><p>If the crying is accompanied with changes in behaviour, if the baby is burning up, or there is any other reason that you suspect the kid might be ill, check your baby's temperature. Fever temperature is anything over 37.5Â°C.</br>If you're in any doubt go to your GP. See warning signs below.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>Does the baby need soothing?</h1><p>Sometimes your baby will just want attention. The following can be helpful:</p><h2>Cuddle & Hum</h2><p>The easiest go-to solution. Hold the baby close to you, supporting its head on your chest, one arm under its bottom the other holding its back. Hum or sing gently to the baby and gently pat the baby's bottom in a heartbeat-like rhythm.</p><h2>Rocking</h2><p>In your arms, in a crib, in the pram. Any movement is good. However, don't use this as a method to lull the baby asleep as they get too used to it and they may become unable to sleep without rocking.</p><h2>Soother/pacifier</h2><p>Always make sure you're sanitising these regularly. Be warned, it's a tough habit to break.</p><h2>Colic hold</h2><p>Put the baby face down on your arm with its head towards your elbow, tummy on the palm of your hand. Lowering your arm, so that its head is above its stomach. This hold can also help with wind.</p><h2>Walk</h2><p>The outdoors provides fresh air and a distraction for both of you. Get out and about and stay active.</p><h2>Distract</h2><p>Your baby might just be bored - new games or a change of environment can help.</p><h2>Get naked</h2><p>Some babies like the feeling of being free. You could try taking off your baby's nappy and letting it kick about, or pop it in the bath and jump in yourself to play.</p><h2>Swaddle</h2><p>The opposite can be true too, tightly wrapping your baby in blankets can make it feel more secure.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Sometimes babies just need to cry it out before they sleep. Try not to get frustrated. Use your best judgement and continue to monitor the baby.</p></div><div class="warning-list"><h1>Warning Signs</h1><ul><p></p><li>Crying combined with a high temperature.</li><p></p><li>High pitched and weak crying.</li><p></p><li>Turning blue.</li><p></p><li>Difficulty breathing.</li><p></p><li>Any red-purple rash.</li><p></p><li>Refusing fluids.</li><p></p><li>Floppy limbs.</li></ul></div><div class="normal"><p>Unfortunately, some babies cry more than most. In fact, there might be constant crying for three hours a day or periods of intense crying where your baby looks like it is in pain, but in fact isn't. It can be a difficult phase, but it's a natural part of development. It usually eases off after five months. Get to know your baby's patterns and if you're in doubt seek advice from your GP.</p></div></div>
