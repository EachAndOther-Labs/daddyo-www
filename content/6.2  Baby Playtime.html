<div class="three-six-months"><h1>Baby Playtime</h1><div class="normal"><h1>playing with the baby</h1><p>Playing is an important part of learning for children of all ages. It's how they grow and develop and learn everything from basic motor skills, to how to communicate. </br>As your baby gets older and learns how to sit up and interact with the world, your games can become more physical and a lot more interactive.</p><h1>The Bang Things Together game</h1><p>Give the baby little wooden or plastic blocks that it can easily grip. Show it how to bang them together. That's it. That's a game.</p><h1>Knee Rides</h1><p>Put the kid on your knees and bounce it up and down gently. It's a good one to do with nursery rhymes. Also, learn some nursery rhymes.</p><h1>Bath Time</h1><p>By three months you'll be able to introduce toys into bath time that the baby can hold and play with. You can gently splash around too, if the kid enjoys the water.</p><h1>Blowing Bubbles</h1><p>Keeping bubbles on hand at all times is a good idea. After about four months or so the baby will be able to focus its eyes far enough ahead to be entertained by them.</p><h1>Gotcha!</h1><p>Children learn to anticipate actions at around four months. You can sneak up in a  mock-threatening way, and then inflict tickles and cuddles. This sounds really dumb but once you do this once, it's hard to stop.</p><h1>Aeroplanes</h1><p>This one's easy - pick the baby up and fly it around in your arms like an aeroplane or a rocket, making all the correct noises. This is about 80% of what being a dad is about.</p><h1>This Little Piggy</h1><p>Does this bring back memories? Count off your baby's toes to the This Little Piggy nursery rhyme. Why do they like it? We don't know. But they do.</p></div></div>
