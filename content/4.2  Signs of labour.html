<div class="labour"><h1>Signs of labour</h1><div class="normal"><h1>What's happening</h1><p>The neck of your partner's womb is opening up in preparation for the birth. This is the first stage of labour, called early labour. And there's no need to panic. Really.  It can go on for a while. It's likely that your partner will know herself that labour is starting but you should be aware of the signs too.</p><p>Hang on, because it's all about to go a little nuts.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>How to recognise early labour</h1><h2>Strong, long, regular contractions</h2><p>The most reliable sign that pregnancy is starting. Your partner's womb is tensing and then relaxing. These are going to be a lot more pronounced than the Braxton Hicks contractions. If the contractions are lasting 30-60 seconds and are at 5 minute intervals, time to get in contact with the hospital or midwife, and go grab your contraction kit.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Don't be over eager. If you get to the hospital too soon, you may just be sent home again. Stick to the plan. Time the contractions and if in doubt call the midwife or the hospital.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>A show</h2><p>This is when the mucus that is plugging the cervix comes away. It's a blob of jelly like stuff, possibly with some blood in it. It's not always obvious, and for some women it doesn't come away until much later in labour. If it does happen, call the midwife or hospital. They'll probably tell you to stay put but best to check in.</p><p>A show is evidence that the cervix is starting to open. Labour can follow immediately or it can take a few days. It's a wait and see situation. Nevertheless, it's time to double check the hospital bags.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Warning sign</h2><p>A little blood in the show is fine and to be expected. If there's continued bleeding though, call the midwife or the hospital.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Waters breaking</h2><p>This is amniotic fluid draining from the vagina. The baby has been growing in what's called an amniotic sac. When the membrane breaks the fluid comes out the vagina. It can either be a sudden a gush or just a trickle. It's the traditional sign of labour starting but in many cases it doesn't happen until much later in labour.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Warning sign</h2><p>Amniotic fluid is a little yellowish and actually looks a lot like urine. It might have a little blood in it to begin with, but not much. Extra blood means you need to seek medical advice.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Warning sign</h2><p>If your partner's waters break, and there's no other signs of the onset of labour, call the midwife or hospital. Without the protection of the amniotic sac the baby may be at risk of infection. It's likely you'll be told to wait for 24 hours and after that point the baby may be induced. But call, and get advice.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>When D-day is getting near, keep a towel on standby. It's also not a bad idea to put some plastic sheeting on the bed in the last week or so of the pregnancy. And don't forget to throw a covering into the car to protect the seats.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>Backache</h1><p>Technically backache can be a sign that labour is starting. But since your partner may already be suffering from back pain, it's probably nothing to get over excited by.</p><h1>Toilet emergency</h1><p>Sometimes the baby pushes down on the bladder as it moves into position for birth. This can mean that your partner needs to rush to the toilet. Again, this could be happening a lot anyway.</p></div></div>
