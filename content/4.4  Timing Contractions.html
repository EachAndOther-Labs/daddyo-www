Each contraction will start, peak, and then subside.</br>If she gets a few in a row in a regular pattern, start timing them. It's probably the onset of labour.</p><ol><li>Start the timer at the beginning of a contraction.</li><li>Jot down the contraction number (1,2,3...) so you can keep track of how many contractions she's had, and the exact start time.</li><li>When the contraction subsides, stop the watch and mark down the total duration of the contraction.</li><li>Repeat this process for every contraction.</li><li>If there's pain, or any changes between contractions write them down as additional notes.</li></ol></div><div class="normal"><p>The time between contraction start times is the interval between contractions. You can recognise labour because these intervals will start to get shorter and the contractions will become more intense.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>When contractions are 3 to 4 minutes apart, and have a duration of 45 to 60 seconds, it's time to get to the hospital.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>False contractions - contractions that are not signs of labour starting -  do not follow a recognisable pattern. They may also disappear if your partner shifts position. Labour contractions won't. Once they start, they won't quit till the baby's out. </p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>You might consider having a backup contraction timing kit in the car or in the hospital bag so that it's close at hand should you need it.</p></div></div>
