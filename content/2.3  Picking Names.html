<div class="second-trimester"><h1>Picking Names</h1><div class="normal"><h1>Picking names</h1><p>When couples start thinking of having kids they play the what'll-we-name-our-kids game. It can be a lot less fun when you're playing for keeps and both parties start playing rough.</br>To keep it clean, and to keep arguments to a minimum, here's the rules to the Daddyo baby name game.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>Phases</h1><h2>Research phase</h2><p>Go through a 'research phase'. Get inspiration from books, movies, wherever. (Ironman is not a name) Have a time limit on this part - a week, a month, it doesn't matter. Although, it's probably a good idea to do it a bit before the due date.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Top 10 lists</h2><p>On a pre-arranged day, both you and your partner each make a top 10 list of your favourite names. Five boys' names, five girls' names. If you already know the gender of the baby, you only get five names in total.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Swap lists</h2><p>Swap the lists over. You each get two vetoes, one for each gender, and you get to cross the offending names off the list your partner made.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Ranking</h2><p>Now rank the remaining names from your partner's selection in your order of preference. Working together, eliminate names by:</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Too popular?</h2><p>Checking the remaining choices against the current most popular current children's names. You probably don't want your baby's name to be too common.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Family name?</h2><p>Noting any family connections to any of the names - would a connection be a good thing or a bad thing?</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Too cute?</h2><p>Asking if any of the names are cute for a kid, but odd for a grown man or woman?</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Bully-proof?</h2><p>Looking for negative connotations for the names, either historically or in fiction? Do they rhyme with anything that could lead to a schoolyard annoyance.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Swap back</h2><p>Check what's left on both lists and take it in turns to make the case for the remaining names from your own list.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>Finding any common ground yet?</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Start over</h2><p>If you still can't agree, go back to step one. This time around you're only allowed to take one name from your previous selection.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>Good luck!</p></div><div class="normal"><p>After all of this, be ready to change - when you meet your baby, the name you've spent all this time fighting over may not seem to fit.</p></div></div>
