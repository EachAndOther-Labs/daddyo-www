<div class="zero-three-months"><h1>0-3 Months</h1><div class="normal"><h1>You're a Daddyo!</h1><p>Congratulations. For the next few weeks you're probably going to be on an amazing, constant buzz. But don't get carried away; the first three months can be pretty tough. Expect sleepless nights and a lot of adjustment. It's non-stop feeding, crying and changing nappies - repeat. But the positives are going to blow the negatives away.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>The baby</h1><p>Development happens quickly. At first they won't be able to support the weight of their own head. Newborns probably won't roll over, but might turn from their side to their back. They'll become more active over time, learning to stretch and kick.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>After a few weeks they'll respond to loud noises, and especially the sound of your voice. They will stare at faces, and often examine their own hands and feet.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>By three months they can easily be distracted by unusual sights or sounds. You will be impressed by <i>all</i> of this.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>As well as crying, newborns start to communicate by smiling and blowing bubbles. By about two months, they will try to copy your facial expressions and reach their arms out when they want to be held.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>Your Partner</h1><p>Many women get the baby blues - they feel emotional and weepy immediately following the birth of the baby. This can last for a couple of hours or a few days.</br>Add on the physical effort that labour required, the demands of feeding, and the general caregiving involved in the early stages of the baby's life you understand if your partner is often tired and irritable and maybe even overwhelmed. It should be expected.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>While that's all normal, be conscious that some women suffer from Post-natal depression.</br>Symptoms include, tiredness, sadness, feelings of inadequacy and nervousness. If you suspect that your partner might be suffering from mild or severe PND get advice from your GP. It's a medical condition caused by hormonal imbalance and she might need some help.</p></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Milestones</h1><ul><p></p><li>Mastering feeding.</li><p></p><li>Mastering nappy changing.</li><p></p><li>Mastering bath time.</li></ul></div><div class="warning-list"><h1>Baby warning signs</h1><ul><p></p><li>No improvement in controlling their head over time.</li><p></p><li>Floppy limbs</li><p></p><li>Not gaining weight</li><p></p><li>Not responding to loud noises or visual cues</li><p></p><li>Not able to focus on your eyes</li></ul></div></div>
