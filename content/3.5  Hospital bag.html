<div class="third-trimester"><h1>Hospital bag</h1><div class="normal"><h1>Hospital bag checklist</h1><p>Your partner's midwife will probably advise you on what she should bring to the hospital. She might warn you about bag size restrictions in place at the ward. You'll likely get a handout at antenatal class too.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>Pack all items for the labour ward in their own bag. It makes it easier to find what you need without having the stuff for the ward in the way.</br>Also, you don't know how long your partner's stay in hospital is going to be. Make sure that you know where all the spare clothes, pads and baby things are at home in case the stay is longer than expected.</p></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Your partner</h1><ul><p></p><li>All her toiletries</li><p></p><li>Toothbrush & toothpaste</li><p></p><li>Hairbrush</li><p></p><li>Soap</li><p></p><li>Any other essentials</li><p></p><li>Medication - If she's taking any.</li><p></p><li>Maternity pads - About 24-30 of these. You can get them in the supermarket.</li><p></p><li>Towels - Fresh clean ones.</li><p></p><li>Clothes - Bring several changes of loose, comfortable clothes for labour.</li><p></p><li>Underwear - Five or six pairs of comfortable pants.</li><p></p><li>Supportive bras - Including nursing bras if your partner is going to breastfeed.</li><p></p><li>Homecoming outfit - Something loose and comfortable for your partner to wear coming home</li></ul></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Baby</h1><ul><p></p><li>Baby vest</li><p></p><li>Onesies</li><p></p><li>Nappies - a packet to be sure</li><p></p><li>A baby blanket</li></ul></div><div class="normal">Bring spares of everything. Newborns puke a lot, and new parents can be a bit clumsy changing nappies.</div><div class="yes-list"><h1>You</h1><ul><p></p><li>Wash bag</li><p></p><li>Cash and small change - You don't want to be looking for an ATM or short of change for a vending machine or for parking.</li><p></p><li>Snacks - You're going to be there for a while.</li><p></p><li>Chewing gum - Fresh breath and you won't grind your teeth. Win win.</li><p></p><li>Medication - If you're taking any.</li><p></p><li>Chargers - For your phone, iPad, camera and whatever other gadgets you have.</li><p></p><li>Video camera - If you and your partner have agreed to film the birth.</li><p></p><li>Warm clothes - Labour rooms can be very chilly. Have something clean and warm to wear.</li><p></p><li>A pillow - If you're hanging around, or spending the night on an uncomfortable cot a decent pillow can make a big difference.</li><p></p><li>Change of clothes - Including socks and underpants.</li></ul></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Labour can be a pretty nervy, tense time. But there can also be a lot of waiting around. Distractions can help. Bring entertainment. Anything from podcasts to comics to books to new games on your phone to films and TV shows on your tablet. Install a heap of things that you think might appeal to you and your partner. Don't count on catching up on TV shows - you're there to help out.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Phones are pretty unsanitary. If you're planning on capturing the birth with your phone you should probably use some form of antiseptic wipe on it and wash your hands. You should also check with the hospital that it's permitted to use your phone to record or photo. There may be restrictions.</p></div></div>
