<div class="first-trimester"><h1>Food Safety</h1><div class="normal"><h1>Food Safety</h1><p>The best diet during pregnancy is a balanced and nutritious one that promotes steady weight gain. Your partner shouldn't be concerned about putting on weight but equally, that's not an excuse to go to town on takeaways.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>It's generally recommended that your partner eats every three hours and drinks plenty of water. Do not encourage her to 'eat enough for two'. It's not necessary. She eat should just enough for healthy weight gain.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>As always, if your partner experiences anything that you're concerned about - chronic vomiting, loss of appetite, whatever -  visit your GP.</p></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Yes Things</h1><ul><p>LEAN MEATS</p><li>Baked, boiled or grilled.</li><p>POULTRY (FULLY COOKED)</p><li>Healthy low fat protein.</li><p>EGGS (FULLY COOKED)</p><li>They're brilliant.</li><p>FRUIT</p><li>Going crazy on fruit can help with constipation.</li><p>VEGETABLES</p><li>No brainer.</li><p>CEREALS</p><li>Choose whole grains whenever possible.</li><p>NUTS</p><li>Great for healthy fats and protein.</li><p>MILK</p><li>For calcium. You can also get calcium from fortified OJ, cheeses, soup made from proper chicken stock and sardines.</li></ul></div><div class="no-list"><h1>No Things</h1><ul><p>ALCOHOL</p><li>In general, your partner should cut out the booze.</li><p>LIVER</p><li>Has some great qualities, but it can contain too much vitamin A.</li><p>PATE</p><li>High risk of Listeria.</li><p>SWORDFISH, MARLIN, SHARK</p><li>Too high in mercury.</li><p>HOT DOGS</p><li>High risk of Listeria.</li><p>LUNCHEON MEATS</p><li>High risk of Listeria.</li><p>CURED MEATS (PARMA, PROSCUITTO)</p><li>Risk of listeriosis, toxoplamosis.</li><p>SALAMIS</p><li>Risk of listeriosis & toxoplamosis.</li><p>UNCOOKED SMOKED SEAFOOD</p><li>Fine when cooked.</li><p>RAW MILK</p><li>Risk of Listeria and salmonella.</li><p>CERTAIN CHEESES</p><li>(soft, blue vein, mould ripened) same as raw milk.</li><p></p><li><b>CIGARETTES</b> - Yes, it's not a food but we're putting it in here while we're talking about things to give up. If she's a smoker, quitting is going to be really tough on your partner, so you'll have to be supportive. If you smoke too, it'd be a good move to join in and quit. There's no better motivation than a baby on the way.</li></ul></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Maybe</h1><ul><p>BUTTER AND CREAM</p><li>Limit your intake. It's safe, but unhealthy.</li><p>SALT</p><li>Totally fine in moderation. Just try to avoid processed food.</li><p>TUNA</p><li>Once or twice a week max. High but generally safe level of mercury.</li><p>CAFFEINE</p><li>Try to limit to one coffee a day.</li></ul></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Preferably alcohol should be avoided during pregnancy. There are serious risks associated with it, including restricted growth, facial abnormalities and learning disorders. Having said that, the highest risk is during the first three months of the pregnancy and there is some disagreement on whether or not there is a safe level of consumption. One or two units (that's about half a glass of wine) a week after the first trimester may be OK. But it's best to play it safe though and avoid completely. If it removes temptation, support your partner and cut back your own intake.</p></div></div>
