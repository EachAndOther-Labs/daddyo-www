<div class="labour"><h1>Missing due date</h1><div class="normal"><h1>Why are babies born late?</h1><p>Labour usually starts when the time is right. Every pregnancy is different and a late birth, especially the first time around, isn't uncommon. Your baby isn't officially late until two weeks after the actual due date.</br>Unless there's a clear indication that the baby is in trouble of some sort, your hospital or midwife will probably recommend letting nature take its course.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>However, you're probably pretty fed up with everything at this point, so there are some things that you can try, which vary from the science based to the old-wives tales.</p></div><div class="normal"><p>None of them are reliable, so occupy your mind and find something useful to do:</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>What to do?</h1></div><div class="normal"><h2>Cook</h2><p>Use the extra time to cook a lot of freezer ready food. You'll be congratulating yourself on your foresight after the birth.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Plan stuff to do</h2><p>Box sets, walks, evenings out, friends over, books, video games. Do things together, and with other people. No need to get too adventurous - your partner could still go into labour at any time.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Relax</h2><p>Send your partner off for a gentle massage somewhere or run her a bath. And if you have the time, catch up on sleep.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Work</h2><p>Alternatively, work. If you've got a lot on your plate, doing more before the birth might give you a little extra space after it.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>What helps to bring on labour?</h1><p>Not much. There's a lot of advice out there on the internet. It's all pretty much nonsense. Some of it is benign, some of it is ill-advised and some of it is ridiculous. Stick to the following:</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Sex</h2><p>Semen contains prostaglandin which softens the cervis. Sex also causes the release of oxytocin, which is linked to contractions. Don't try this if your partner's waters have already broken.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Light Exercise</h2><p>A walk around a park might work. Even if it doesn't, at least you got out.</p></div></div>
