<div class="zero-three-months"><h1>Lack of Sleep</h1><div class="normal"><h1>Dealing with sleep deprivation</h1><p>The first weeks, and possibly months, can be very disruptive on your sleeping patterns. You'll learn to live with never having enough sleep.</br>However, sleep deprivation can lead to postnatal depression for you or your partner, so don't overlook trying to organise your lives to make it as easy as possible on you both. Talk about it early, and be ready to make compromises and allowances.</p></div><div class="normal"><h1>Try these tactics</h1><h2>Alternate nights</h2><p>Take it in turns to handle most, if not all of the night feeds on alternate nights.Yes, it can mean one horrible day running on hardly any sleep, but you get to catch up the following night. Make sure that you use the maximum amount of sleeping time on your night 'off'. If you partner is breast feeding, you won't be able to help out much on feeds - but you can still take nappy duty.</p><h2>Family and friends</h2><p>Take offers of help from trusted, experienced family and friends. Getting out for half an hour or grabbing a quick nap can have <i>huge</i> benefits.</p><h2>Work balance</h2><p>If you don't have much, or any, paternity leave you and your partner may have to come to an arrangement that allows you to get a little more sleep during the week, with you taking up the slack on the weekends. Don't forget, being unproductive at work because of lack of sleep can create extra stress.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>You've spent a lot of time getting the nursery ready but for the first while, consider keeping the baby's bed near yours for nighttime feeds. It's also the safest place for the baby to sleep.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Watch out for arguments. Lack of sleep can make people ratty. Acknowledge this and don't let it become a problem. Take care of each other.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Consider taking a multivitamin. They can help keep energy levels up when taken over time.</p></div></div>
