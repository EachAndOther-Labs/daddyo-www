<div class="first-trimester"><h1>Finances</h1><div class="normal"><h1>Finances</h1><p>Babies are expensive. But how much you spend is totally up to you and your partner. Like buying a car, you can get a fully kitted out Porsche, or go for an ultra-reliable Toyota that will get the job done just as well.</p><p>As a general rule, don't get carried away. There are lots of good quality, good value products out there. Do some market research online and shop around.</p><p>Whether you do a budget now or not, you will need to do one for the next year.</p><p><h2>Regular chats</h2> You and your partner should set aside time to talk about the figures. Once a month, once every two weeks. Whatever is needed. Stick the dates in the diary and keep to them. You could hold these meet ups in a caf√© or a quiet bar if that makes them less painful.</p></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Sort out figures for</h1><ul><p>Income changes</p><li>Benefit entitlements</li><p></p><li>Loss of earnings (maternity, paternity leave)</li><p></p><li>Tax changes</li><p>Costs</p><li>Birth Medical bills - Obstetrics fees</li><p></p><li>Post natal GP care</li><p></p><li>Childcare costs - Worth thinking about early.</li><p></p><li>Home improvements - Baby proofing/decor.</li><p></p><li>Sleeping kit - Cots, nightlights, baby monitors.</li><p></p><li>Nappies - Lots and lots of these.</li><p></p><li>Car - Is what you drive now appropriate?</li><p></p><li>Car seat - You will need one car seat for the first 12 months or so, and then another larger one.</li><p></p><li>Buggy - You might have a  travel system (a car seat buggy combo) but you'll need another all-purpose buggy at a later stage.</li></ul></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Saving from day one is a good idea. Even if you've been planning for a while, use the nine months to get a budget in place that allows you to put a few quid away. Not everyone can afford to do so, but if you can it'll take some pressure off later.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>People don't need buggies and baby gear forever. Savvy shoppers can pick up great deals on second hand gear, and hand-me-downs are likely to be offered by friends and family. Just make sure that you are satisfied that the items are safe and in good nick. Never buy a second hand car seat.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Make a list of all the major purchases and buy one of them every month for the duration of the pregnancy. It'll be weird buying a bottle steriliser six months in advance but do it now and you won't have a giant last minute panic-shop.</p></div></div>
