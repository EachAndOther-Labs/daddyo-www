Use fresh tap/drinking water each time.</li><li>Let it cool for 30 minutes.</li><li>Follow the guidelines on the formula container.</li><li>Fill the bottle with the exact amount of water required.</li><li>Add in exactly the amount of powder recommend on the formula container.</li><li>Put on the lid and shake it until it's well mixed.</li><li>Fill a bowl or other container with hot water but don't fill it to the top of the container.</li><li>Put the bottle in the container to heat it up. ONLY use this method to heat the bottle. No microwaves. Ever.</li><li>Test the heat of the milk on your wrist. It should feel a little warm but not hot.</li><li>Position the baby comfortably in your arms. Her head should be higher than her body.</li><li>Hold the bottle at an angle so that the teat is filled with milk. Put it fully into her mouth.</li><li>She may stop and start feeding several times. Take your time and do your best to  get her to take the whole bottle.</li><li>If she's done feeding, get rid of any formula that she did take. There's too much of a risk of bacteria.</li><li>Feeding should take about 20 minutes but that's a guideline not a hard and fast rule.</li></ol></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Timers are your friend. Set countdown on your phone for 30 mins as soon as you turn the kettle on.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Change you holding position a few times during the feed. This helps keep the baby focused on the task at hand and it'll give you arms a bit of a break.</p></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Get a few formula holders. Fill them with the right amount of powder you need. Fill a few bottles with boiled and cooled water. Now you have a baby feeding travel pack; all you need it a friendly person to give you a container of hot water to heat up the bottle.</p></div><div class="warning-list"><h1>Warning Signs</h1><ul><p>Refusing to feed</p><li>This might be OK, or a sign that something is wrong. If the baby has missed two or three feedings and seems uncomfortable, it's probably best to head to your GP.</li><p>Vomiting</p><li>Babies vomit <i>a lot</i>. This is often due to swallowing air during feeding. They could also have a bout of gastroenteritis, which they should fight off in a day or two. If you baby is vomiting, monitor its temperature and contact your GP if you're concerned. Persistent vomiting can be a sign of something more serious, including meningitis or an allergy. Be cool, but be vigilant.</li></ul></div></div>
