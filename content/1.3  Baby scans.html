<div class="first-trimester"><h1>Baby scans</h1><div class="normal"><h1>What are they?</h1><p>Ultrasound scans use sound waves to create a picture of the baby in the womb. The sonographer, the person who conducts the test,  will put some gel on your partner's tummy and run a small device over it. The device emits high-frequency sound waves that the machine converts into a picture of your baby on a TV screen. The sonographer will explain the picture to you. There's generally two scans.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>First scan, 8-14 weeks</h2><p>This scan is used to 'date' the baby to see how it's growing.</p></div><div class="normal"><h2>Second scan, 18-21 weeks</h2><p>This is a more detailed scan, which checks for major physical problems. The sonographer may also be able to tell you the sex of your baby, if they can make it out.</p></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Scans can confirm:</h1><ul><p></p><li><b>The baby's size</b> - And its development. The sonographer will be able to point out arms and legs.</li><p></p><li><b>The baby's gender</b> - Talk to your partner before you go in for the scan about whether or not you want to know the sex of the baby. There's not that many real surprises in life - but then again, knowing this might help you deck out the nursery. </li><p></p><li><b>Multiple babies</b> - Yes. It happens. One in eight pregnancies results in twins. Be mentally prepared.</li><p></p><li><b>Physical abnormalities</b> - The sonographer or doctor will advise you if there are any issues.</li><p></p><li><b>Baby position</b> - This is only a factor in later stages of the pregnancy.</li></ul></div><div class="tip"><h1>PRO TIP</h1><p>Some private clinics offer additional ultrasound scans or 3D scans. It's amazing to see what the foetus is up to in there - for you, at least. Your friends aren't going to understand the fascination.</p></div></div>
