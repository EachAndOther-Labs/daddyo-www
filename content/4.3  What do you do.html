<div class="labour"><h1>What do you do?</h1><div class="normal"><h1>What do you do for the birth?</h1><p>Most women like the idea of having their partner with them in the delivery room. It's common to the point of expected these days. You and your partner should agree whether or not you are to be present at the birth.</p><p>It can get pretty hair in there, so if you decide that it's not for you, your partner can ask that another family member - for instance her mother or sister - attend instead. Alternatively, she can be attended by a doula instead.</p></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>General rules</h1><ul><p></p><li>Follow the birth plan.</li><p></p><li>Try to remain calm for your partner's sake.</li><p></p><li>Be supportive.</li><p></p><li>If your partner has specific medical requests reiterate them to the medical team.</li><p></p><li>Think of yourself as a personal assistant to your partner.</li></ul></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Not attending the birth?</h1><ul><p></p><li>Stay in, or close by, the hospital (if that's where you're planning to have the birth).</li><p></p><li>Try to stay occupied or distracted, which can be difficult.</li><p></p><li>Keep the relations informed.</li></ul></div><div class="yes-list"><h1>Attending the birth?</h1><ul><p></p><li>Follow the instructions from your antenatal classes. Ask the midwives where you should stand or what to do if you're not sure. They'll tell you anyway if you're getting in the way.</li><p></p><li>If your partner doesn't opt for an epidural, it may seem like she is being tortured. Do not panic, stay levelled headed and calm .</li><p></p><li>Follow the medical staffs' instructions to the letter</li></ul></div><div class="normal"><p>Newborns can look pretty strange, have wrinkles or even cone heads. They change their appearance very quickly over a few days. Be tactful about how you react. If you think about making some crack about how weird the baby looks, keep it to yourself. Your partner has just done a lot of work to get this kid here in one piece.</br>Don't worry - it'll start looking like a normal baby pretty soon.</p></div></div>
